### Game screnario
- Game starts with the Player one.
- each player need to matching 2 card to get points.
- If the cards don’t match (it’s not a pair), current Player turns them back over and it’s then the turn of next Player to turn over two new cards..
- However, if the two cards match, it’s a pair! The respective player keeps the cards and has the right to play again.
- Game will end if the whole card are opened
- The player who has the most points is the winner
- If Player One has the same points as Player Two, the result will be Draw
